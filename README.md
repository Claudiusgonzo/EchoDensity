| `Figs_1_2.m` | Generates Figures 1 and 2 from the paper, demonstrating step-by-step application of the complete algorithm to a shoebox impulse response. |
| `Fig_6.m` | Generates Figure 6 in paper, illustrating changes in echo density by computing echo density curves on IRs for a series of shoeboxes with ceiling progressively slid open, and fitting the temporal echo density model proposed in the paper, implemented in the function `curve_fitting()`. |
| `core/` | Main signal processing algorithms |
| `data/` | Synthetic impulse response data usable with the scripts |

| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Guidelines for contributing to the sample. |

## Prerequisites

Matlab scripts were tested on R2018a

## Notes
- The algorithms here compute the echo density as an *unnormalized* percentage value that is 0 for a Dirac delta and 50 for a constant signal. 
- Divide with the value obtained from `gaussian_measure()` to turn sorted-center-time into a normalized echo density that is 0 for Dirac impulse and 1 for Gaussian noise.
